# Competitive Programming
This repository contains a collection of competitive programming problems I, **Poonyapat Sriroth**, have solved for practicing. Problems here are mainly about mathematics, observation, and data structures and algorithms. Some problems could be solved by using simple techniques (e.g. binary search, tree structure, and dynamic programming), while others might require more advanced algorithms (e.g. segment tree and its variation, persistent data structure, decomposition, and many more) and also many many special optimization techniques to reduce the time complexity of the program.

Problems here include both international (which can be found online) and Thailand local (thus, no English version). The older competitive programming problems require you to write input/ output yourself, however, the newer version, you just have to complete the function (the input/output part is given), which both of them can be found in this repository.

# About me in Competitive Programming
- **IOI2023** @Hungary, representative of Thailand
- **ICPC regional contest**:
  - Silver medalist in ICPC2024 Nanjing Regional
  - Silver medalist in ICPC2024 Shanghai Regional
  - Silver medalist in ICPC2024 Xi'an Regional (East Asia Final)
- The second highest score in **TOI18** and gold medalist

Currently, I am part of the **IOI Thailand Staff Team**, organizing the training camp for selecting the next representative of Thailand joining IOI. I also created tasks for **ICPC Thailand National Round** and **ICPC Chulalongkorn Internal Round**. At last, I am a part of **ICPC CUHK team**.
